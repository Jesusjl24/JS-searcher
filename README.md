```python
SCRAPING_CONFIG = {
    "max_jobs_limit": 50,          # Maximum jobs per search
    "request_delay_min": 2,        # Minimum delay between requests
    "request_delay_max": 4,        # Maximum delay between requests
    "max_retries": 3,              # Retry attempts for failed requests

## 🛡️ Anti-Blocking Protection (NEW!)

The scraper now includes **professional-grade anti-blocking** features to protect you from IP bans and rate limiting - all **100% FREE**!

### Features Enabled by Default

✅ **User Agent Rotation** - Randomly rotate between 12+ real browser user agents
✅ **Request Header Randomization** - Mimic real browser headers
✅ **Intelligent Rate Limiting** - Smart delays with jitter and human-like patterns
✅ **Browser Fingerprint Randomization** - Random viewports and settings
✅ **Session Rotation** - Automatically rotate sessions after N requests
✅ **Exponential Backoff** - Smart retry logic for failed requests

### Why This is Better Than Free Proxies

**Free Proxies ❌**
- Unreliable and slow
- Often malicious
- Short-lived
- Can be blocked faster than your IP

**Our Multi-Layer Strategy ✅**
- Always available
- No performance impact
- More effective at avoiding blocks
- No security risks

### Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:

```python
ANTI_BLOCKING_CONFIG = {
    "enabled": True,  # Master switch
    "use_rate_limiting": True,  # Smart delays
    "use_header_rotation": True,  # Random headers
    "use_session_rotation": True,  # Session management
    "use_time_scheduling": False,  # Only scrape during business hours (optional)

    # Rate limiting (seconds)
    "rate_limit_base_delay": 2.0,  # Minimum delay
    "rate_limit_max_delay": 5.0,   # Maximum delay
    "rate_limit_jitter": True,      # Random variation
    "rate_limit_human_like": True,  # Occasional longer pauses

    # Session settings
    "session_lifetime_requests": 10,  # Rotate after N requests

    # Optional: Add proxies if you have them (not recommended for free proxies)
    "proxies": [],  # Format: ["http://ip:port"]
}
```

### How It Works

1. **User Agent Rotation**: Each request uses a different browser signature
2. **Smart Delays**: Variable delays between requests (2-5s base + human-like patterns)
3. **Human-Like Behavior**:
   - Every 5-10 requests: takes a longer break (5-15s)
   - 5% chance of extended break (30-60s)
   - Mimics someone reading job descriptions
4. **Session Management**: Creates new browser session every 10 requests
5. **Fingerprint Randomization**: Different viewport sizes and settings each time

### Performance Impact

- **Speed**: Slightly slower due to delays (by design!)
- **Success Rate**: Much higher (fewer blocks)
- **Recommendation**: Better to scrape 5 jobs safely than get blocked scraping 50

### Adding Proxies (Optional)

If you have access to **paid** proxy services, you can add them:

```python
# In config.py
ANTI_BLOCKING_CONFIG = {
    ...
    "proxies": [
        "http://proxy1.example.com:8080",
        "http://proxy2.example.com:8080",
    ]
}
```

**Note**: We don't recommend free proxy lists - they're usually slower and less reliable than using no proxy.

### Best Practices

1. **Keep max_jobs low** (5-10) even with anti-blocking
2. **Space out searches** - don't search every minute
3. **Use business hours** - enable `use_time_scheduling` to only scrape 9 AM-6 PM
4. **Be respectful** - SEEK provides a service, don't abuse it

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_utils.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

### Manual Testing

Test individual modules:

```bash
# Test scraper
python src/scraper.py

# Test LLM scorer
python src/llm_scorer.py
```

---

## 📊 How It Works

### 1. Job Scraping

The scraper uses Selenium to:
1. Build a SEEK URL with your search criteria
2. Navigate to the search results page
3. Extract job cards using BeautifulSoup
4. Parse job details (title, company, location, salary, description)
5. Optionally fetch full descriptions from individual job pages
6. Save results to CSV

### 2. Resume Analysis

The AI resume parser:
1. Extracts text from your resume (supports PDF, DOCX, TXT)
2. Sends text to Mistral AI with structured prompting
3. Parses response to extract:
   - Technical and soft skills
   - Years of experience
   - Education and certifications
   - Previous job titles
   - Industries worked in
   - Career achievements

### 3. Job Matching

The AI job matcher:
1. Takes your resume profile and job details
2. Sends both to Mistral AI for comparison
3. Returns comprehensive analysis:
   - Overall match score (0-100)
   - Skill match percentage
   - Detailed reasoning
   - Pros and cons
   - Identified gaps
   - Strategic considerations

## ⚙️ Architecture

### Key Design Patterns

- **Modular Architecture**: Separation of concerns with dedicated modules
- **Context Managers**: Proper resource cleanup for Selenium drivers
- **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions and graceful degradation
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Smart Truncation**: Sentence-boundary-aware text truncation
- **Input Validation**: Sanitization and validation of all user inputs

### Performance Optimizations

- **Caching**: Session state caching for job scores
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable delays between requests
- **Lazy Loading**: Full descriptions fetched only when needed
- **Resource Pooling**: Context managers for driver lifecycle

---

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Implemented Protections

✅ **Input Sanitization**: All search terms and locations are sanitized
✅ **File Validation**: Resume uploads validated for type and size
✅ **API Key Protection**: Environment variables for sensitive data
✅ **Rate Limiting**: Prevents overwhelming SEEK servers
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful failures without exposing internals

### Best Practices

- Never commit `.env` file (in `.gitignore`)
- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Use HTTPS for all API calls
- Limit file upload sizes
- Implement request rate limiting

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- Default: 5 jobs per search
- Recommendation: Keep searches small to avoid IP bans
- SEEK may block excessive requests

### AI Accuracy
- AI analysis is probabilistic, not guaranteed
- Review all job matches manually
- Results depend on resume quality and job description detail

### Browser Requirements
- Requires Chrome browser installed
- Headless mode enabled by default
- May require ChromeDriver updates

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"ChromeDriver not found"**
```bash
# The app auto-downloads ChromeDriver, but if it fails:
pip install --upgrade webdriver-manager
```

**"MISTRAL_API_KEY not found"**
```bash
# Create .env file with:
echo "MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
```

**"Module not found" errors**
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

**Resume parsing fails**
```bash
# Check file format:
# - PDF: Must be text-based (not scanned images)
# - DOCX: Must be valid Word document
# - TXT: Must be UTF-8 encoded
```

**No jobs found**
```bash
# Try:
# 1. Broader search terms
# 2. Fewer filters
# 3. Different location
# 4. Wait a few minutes (possible rate limiting)
```
